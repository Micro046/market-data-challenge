# Market Data Specialist Challenge Program

The **Market Data Specialist Challenge Program** is designed to help candidates explore real-world data analysis problems inspired by our research workflows. Each challenge focuses on market structure, liquidity dynamics, and anomaly detection â€” allowing you to demonstrate both analytical thinking and familiarity with on-chain and crypto market data.

The program currently includes two challenges, and you can complete either one of your choice. All details for both challenges can be found in their dedicated files within this repository.
Good luck â€” and have fun diving into the data! ðŸš€
