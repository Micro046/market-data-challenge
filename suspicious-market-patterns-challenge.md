# Market Data Analysis for Suspicious Patterns

The objective of this challenge is to conduct a sample investigation of cryptocurrency market activity. Using the provided cryptocurrency exchange datasets, the goal is to uncover and explain any suspicious trading behaviors or anomalies, and present the findings in a clear, well-documented report with supporting charts.

The sample market data files include:

- [eth-btc-orderbooks.csv](https://github.com/1712n/market-data-challenge/blob/main/eth-btc-orderbooks.csv)
- [eth-btc-trades.csv](https://github.com/1712n/market-data-challenge/blob/main/eth-btc-trades.csv)

Your task is to:

1. Analyze the datasets for any suspicious or unusual trading patterns (e.g., wash trading, pump-and-dump behavior, abnormal volume spikes, manipulative price movements, or other anomalies).
2. Produce a concise report describing your findings. The report should include both:

     - Written analysis explaining the suspicious patterns you identified and why they may indicate manipulation or irregular activity.
     - Charts/visualizations (e.g., time-series, distributions, comparisons) that support your conclusions.

3. Submit your results as a pull request to this repository. The PR should include:

     - A markdown report with your analysis and charts.
     - The code you used to generate the results (Jupyter notebook or script).

_Please also email your pull request link along with your resume to challenge-submission@blockshop.org._
